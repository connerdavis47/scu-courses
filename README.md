### Problem

When students are registering for classes, they have to consider hundreds of options while also keeping track of prerequisites, “double-dip” opportunities, classes that can be substituted for others, and other nuances. Many students also work weekly hours and/or participate in sports and other extracurricular activities, creating delicate schedule restrictions. To make matters worse, the school website is cluttered and difficult to navigate, making it hard to find the information you need to plot the best path to your degree.

Currently, CourseAvail is the only way students can try to put a schedule together, allowing users to search for classes to see which sections are offered. CourseAvail also has a weekly calendar, which is useful, but breaks entirely on phones and tablets. While providing a much needed service, CourseAvail does not help students figure out what classes they should take, forcing them to seek out the information ahead of time. Most importantly, CourseAvail only lets you look at one class at a time, making comparing potential classes a difficult and tedious process. This means that even if you know exactly what classes you need to take, you will still spend lots of precious time putting a schedule together.

### Solution 

We want to take advantage of relevant datasets, like degree requirements and other information pertinent to the individual student. Students can log in via SCU Single Sign-On to quickly provide the web application with their degree, school year, and any previously taken courses.

Leveraging this information, we can recommend students entire schedules to choose from. For example, let’s say a senior COEN major were to ask for “two core classes and two electives”, with volleyball practice MF from 3-5. The system would suggest all schedules it can find that conform to those specifications.

With this system, the student has access to all the knowledge they need in order to find the best class schedule immediately rather than working for hours with the existing solution to, maybe, reach the same conclusion. The system will make registration substantially less time-consuming, stressful and intimidating for students, helping them find new class opportunities they didn’t realize existed before.
