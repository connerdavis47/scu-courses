An experiential and academic understanding of mindfulness will be emphasized.  The experiential component will involve training in meditation and mindfulness practices.  The academic component will involve rigorous examination of current research on the applications of mindfulness in health care, as well as exploration of current theories of mindfulness and its applications to clinical work.  The intention of the course is to help students better understand the construct of mindfulness and how it can be applied in clinical practice, as a technique for clients, a theoretical frame for therapists, and as a means of enhancing therapist skills, for example, empathy and attention.  A final intention is for students to explore the potential benefits of mindfulness for their own self-care and self-inquiry.\nThis course, as stated in its title, involves three components, theory, research and practice.  Theory includes both classical and contemporary perspectives, including the traditional teachings of the Buddha as well as contemporary Western perspectives on mindfulness.  The research component surveys and summarizes the research on mindfulness-based interventions with an emphasis on the more recent well-controlled designs.  The therapy component examines clinical studies of therapeutic applications, of which there are now many, including the treatment of anxiety and depression, eating disorders and chronic pain. \nAt the core of the course is training in mindfulness.  Several types of mindfulness practices will be introduced, including concentrative breath awareness, body scan meditation, mindful movement, and emotive practices (e.g. the cultivation of love and compassion).  Experiential practice will offer students a deeper understanding of meditation and its potential implications.  Too often, in academic courses, students are left with a cognitive understanding of materials; however they are at a loss for how to incorporate this knowledge into their life.  This is especially critical in the field of counseling psychology, where the content of the courses is intended to be directly applied in the therapy sessions.  I believe contemplative practices will help students bring specific qualities and skills into embodiment.  Further, thru connecting contemplative practices with the content of psychotherapy, it is likely that greater insights and deeper appreciation of the material under study will occur.', '3.00', '3.00', 'A'),

However, little attention has been focused on human strengths, such as compassion, altruism, self-actualization and spirituality, positive aspects of human psychology. This advanced seminar will draw on the pioneering field of Mindfulness and Positive Psychology, to delve deeper into the theory, science and practice of human health and flourishing. The seminar is designed to foster creative thinking about concepts and methods, and most importantly to give students an experiential understanding of practices designed to cultivate greater mental, physical, emotional and spiritual health. The emphasis of this experiential course will be on advanced training in mindfulness and positive psychology practices, such as forgiveness and compassion practices. The intention of this course is to help evolve a deeper and more systemic understanding of positive psychological health and to learn specific practices to that help cultivate positive psychological strengths such as compassion, awareness, emotional intelligence, empathy, forgiveness, and peace. The course is designed to encourage you to think critically about what it means to be healthy and fully actualized, drawing on the scientific literature as well as using your personal moment to moment experiences as the laboratory.\n\n*Notes* This course is a study abroad course, with significant financial commitment from the student, in additional to course tuition.

One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.', '1.00', '1.00', 'A'),

Balthasar argues that logic and truth operate in the four areas of: (1) nature, (2) freedom, (3) mystery and (4) participation. Is machine intelligence possible without incorporating these themes into its programming? By aligning the machine to each of these four broad concerns, will the machine then become not only self-conscious, but alos, aware of the existence of a Transcendent Being?

Don Bosco was a son of his century and therefore the language, the approach, the theology and especially the Church of this century, together with the historical events that were emerging in Europe and especially in Italy, influenced his thought and his modus operandi.

This vision of ^Oneness^ is expounded in the ancient sacred texts of philosophical theology knowns as the Upanishads, which form the final books of the canonical Veda, the original revealed scripture of Hinduism. In this course, we will study key portions of several of the prominent Upanishads with a view to gaining an in-depth understanding of the vision of non-duality, especially as it pertains to the pedagogy of self-knowledge, and its relationship to concepts of bondage, liberation and the layers of reality. We will be aided in our study by the commentaries on the Upanishads by Shankaracharya, the famous 8th C philosopher-monk who is viewed as the first systematic theologian in Hinduism. Shankaracharya&apos;s views on the Upanishads unfold the vision of oneness in a systematic and creative manner and help resolve the apparent paradoxes and duality that the study of oneness inevitably poses-between the individual and the universe, between the teacher and student, and between oneself and God. Some previous courses in Hinduism and/or knowledge of Sanskrit is advantageous, but not essential. Attendance and class participation are mandatory.

The course will help you learn to break down real life situations and understand the fine points at which religious innovation and change occur, even when people try to resist change or return to the past. Audio files of weekly lectures, illustrated with slides, and videos are provided for each week. Readings from primary sources in translation are indicated on the course schedule. The readings will illustrate history, but more importantly, they will give you the opportunity to develop basic skills in assessing and evaluating the belief and behavior of religious communities in the real world. Weekly exercises will ask you to apply analytical skills, draw conclusions, and communicate them to your peers.
